# Google Data Analytics Course - Capstone Project using Python (January 2025)
# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?  🚴🚲👩‍💻📈📊

This project contains a solution using python for the Capstone of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) from [Google](https://www.coursera.org/google-career-certificates) 

> This project was inspired by a [previous implementation](https://github.com/carlacotas/google-data-analytics-capstone-case-study-trackA-cyclistic) I developed using the R programming language. Although this version using Python is a distinct solution, some phrases and ideas in the presentation of this solution may be similar to the original R project. This is intentional, as the challenge and problem-solving approach remains consistent across both implementations.

## Introduction 

In this case study, I will take on the role of a junior data analyst performing real-world tasks for a fictional company, Cyclistic, working in the marketing analytics team. To address the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: [Ask](#ask), [Prepare](#prepare), [Process](#process), [Analyze](#analyze), [Share](#share), and [Act](#act).

## Background and Business Question

### Cyclistic

Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, launched in 2016 a successful bike-share offering. Since then, has grown to 5,824 geotracked bicycles and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistic bikes can be accessed from one station and returned to any other station in the network, anytime. This bike-share program includes traditional bikes and more inclusive options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes useful to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. While most users ride for leisure, 30% use the bikes for commuting to work each day.

Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes (for casual riders), and annual memberships (for members). Cyclistic’s finance analysts have found that annual members are more profitable, and the director of marketing sees an opportunity to grow by converting casual riders into members, as they are already familiar with the Cyclistic program. Rather than targeting all-new customers, she believes the focus should be on converting casual riders into members, as they are already familiar with Cyclistic and rely on it for their mobility needs.
