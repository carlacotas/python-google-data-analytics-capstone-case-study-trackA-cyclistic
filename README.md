# Google Data Analytics Course - Capstone Project using Python (January 2025)
# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?  🚴🚲👩‍💻📈📊

This project contains a solution using python for the Capstone of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) from [Google](https://www.coursera.org/google-career-certificates) 

> This project was inspired by a [previous implementation](https://github.com/carlacotas/google-data-analytics-capstone-case-study-trackA-cyclistic) I developed using the R programming language. Although this version using Python is a distinct solution, some phrases and ideas in the presentation of this solution may be similar to the original R project. This is intentional, as the challenge and problem-solving approach remains consistent across both implementations.
